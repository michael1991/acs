# Access Jupyter services by means of port forwarding {#concept_und_p5g_vdb .concept}

Accessing Jupyter services by means of port forwarding has the following advantages. However, the settings are complicated.

-   Save your cost because no Server Load Balancer instance needs to be purchased.
-   You can access Jupyter services from outside without opening a port on the official website.

In the following example, your Jupyter services are SSH accessed by forwarding the access request by means of the local port 12345.

## Step 1 Set up the SSH tunnel {#section_kqj_dvg_vdb .section}

**In MAC OS X and Linux**

Run the following command to connect the local port with the Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\) instance.

```
ssh -ND 12345 root@39. 252
```

`12345` is the local port to be used, which can be customized. `39. 252` is the public Elastic IP \(EIP\) bound to your ECS instance.

**Note:** You can log on to the [ECS console](https://ecs.console.aliyun.com/#/home) to check the public EIP bound to the ECS instance. If your ECS instance is not bound with a public EIP, bind one to your ECS instance. For more information, see [Manage a public EIP address](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/zh/doc-detail/51995.htm).

**In Windows**

1.  Configure local port forwarding.

    Run PuTTY and configure the SSH **Tunnels**.

    1.  Set **Source port**. In this example, it is 12345.
    2.  Select **Dynamic**.
    3.  Click **Add**.

2.  Log on to the ECS instance.
    1.  Run PuTTY. Configure the **Session**, and then click **Open**.

        Enter the IP address, namely, the public EIP of the ECS instance. In this example, it is 39. 252.

    2.  In the displayed dialog box, enter your logon account and password for the ECS instance.

        Then, you have successfully logged on to the ECS instance.

## Step 2 Configure network connection of the browser {#section_dcn_1wg_vdb .section}

**For Firefox**

If you use the Firefox browser, open the browser, click **Tools** \> **Options** \> **Advanced** \> **Network** , and click **Settings** in the **Connection** section. In the displayed window, set the **SOCKS Host**.

![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/7429/15336968722136_en-US.png)

**For Chrome**

Run the following command:

```
Chrome --proxy-server="socks5://localhost:12345" --host-resolver-rules="MAP * 0.0.0.0 , EXCLUDE localhost" --user-data-dir=/tmppath/
```

**Wherein:**

-   `12345` is the local port in use.
-   For Windows, `/tmppath/` can be written as `d:/tmppath` or a similar path. For Linux or MAC OS X, /tmppath/ can be written as `/tmp/`.

The location of Chrome varies with operating systems, as described in the following table.

|Operating system|Location of Chrome|
|:---------------|:-----------------|
|Mac OS X|/Applications/Google\\ Chromapp/Contents/MacOS/Google\\ Chrome|
|Linux|/usr/bin/google-chrome|
|Windows|C:\\Program Files \(x86\)\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe|

Take Windows as an example.

## Step 3 Access Jupyter services {#section_z4c_x5g_vdb .section}

In your browser, enter the access address of a Jupyter service. In this example, access the address 192. 83:32769. Then, you can access the Jupyter service by using SSH from outside.

**Firefox:**

**Chrome:**
